# Fake News Detector

## Overview

Fake News Detector is a Python-based project that aims to detect and classify fake news articles using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes natural language processing and a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze the content of news articles and determine their credibility.

The Fake News Detector project is designed to help individuals and organizations identify unreliable or deceptive news sources and prevent the spread of misinformation. By providing a tool that can automatically assess the veracity of news articles, this project contributes to the fight against fake news and promotes media literacy.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+

Flask 2.0.1

scikit-learn 0.24.2

pandas 1.3.1

numpy 1.21.1

spaCy v3.1.4


## Features

#### Fake News Classification: 
The project employs a machine learning model to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content.
#### Pre-processing: 
The project performs various text pre-processing tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to prepare the text data for classification.
#### Feature Extraction: 
The content of news articles is transformed into numerical feature vectors using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
#### Machine Learning Model: 
The project uses a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a classifier such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines) to classify the news articles.
#### Model Evaluation: 
The project evaluates the performance of the machine learning model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps assess the model's effectiveness in classifying fake news.
#### Web Interface: 
The project provides a user-friendly web interface where users can submit news articles and get instant predictions on their credibility.
## Setup And Usage

#### To use the Fake News Detector project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detector.git
```
2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Prepare the Dataset: Obtain a dataset of labeled news articles for training and testing the model. Ensure that the dataset contains both real and fake news articles with appropriate labels.

4. Pre-process the Data: Implement any necessary data pre-processing steps, such as cleaning the text, removing stop words, and performing stemming. This can be done using libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy.

5. Train the Model: Train the machine learning model using the pre-processed dataset. You can choose a suitable classifier and tune its hyperparameters based on your requirements.

6. Evaluate Model Performance: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps assess the model's effectiveness in classifying fake news.

7. Deploy the Web Interface: Build and deploy the web interface that allows users to interact with the Fake News Detector. You can use frameworks like Flask or Django to create a server-side application and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end.

8. Make Predictions: Users can submit news articles through the web interface, and the trained model will classify them as real or fake. Display the prediction results to the users along with any additional information that helps them understand the credibility of the articles.
